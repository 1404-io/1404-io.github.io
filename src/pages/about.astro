        Why 1404 Exists

    <!-- The Motive -->
    <div class="mb-20">
      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-text-primary mb-6">The Motive</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Growing up in Detroit, you see the pattern. Manufacturing floors that run on tribal knowledge. Construction firms where the most critical processes live in someone's head, or worse, in a spreadsheet no one else understands. Companies doing $20M, $50M, $100M in revenue with technology infrastructure that belongs in 2008.
        </p>
        <p>
          It isn't laziness. It isn't ignorance. It's a market failure. The people who build technology don't want to work in construction. The people who run construction companies can't find the people who build technology. The recruiting pipeline doesn't exist. The cultural bridge doesn't exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          So these companies do what they can. They buy SaaS tools. They hire consultants who leave. They duct-tape systems together with Zapier and prayer. And the gap between what their operations could be and what their operations are gets wider every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          1404 exists because that gap is unnecessary.

    <!-- The Mechanism -->
    <div class="mb-20">
      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-text-primary mb-6">The Mechanism</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          We're not consultants — consultants deliver a PDF and leave. We're not a dev shop — dev shops build what you spec, not what you need. And we're not a SaaS company — SaaS is generic by definition, and half the time you're paying more for the features that actually matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          1404 is a permanent technology department. We provide the CTO who sets strategy, the engineers who build custom systems around your operations, and the ongoing R&D to make sure you stay ahead of the curve, not behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you hire a CTO, they spend six months learning your business before they're useful. When you hire 1404, you get someone who already understands construction, already has the architecture patterns, and already knows what works. The learning curve is weeks, not years.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Why It Matters -->
    <div class="mb-20">
      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-text-primary mb-6">Why It Matters</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Give one person a shovel and another person an excavator. Come back in a week. The difference isn't 2x. It isn't 10x. It's a different category of output entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's what technology does to operations. Not incrementally better. Categorically different. The company with real-time labor forecasting doesn't just schedule better than the company using spreadsheets. They're playing a different game. The company with AI agents monitoring every workflow doesn't just catch problems faster. They prevent problems the other company doesn't even know it has.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the advantage compounds. Every month the system learns more. Every quarter the institutional knowledge deepens. After two years, the technology department knows things about your operations that no single person in your company knows. After five years, the gap between you and the company that didn't invest is insurmountable.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's not a sales pitch. That's math.
        </p>

    <!-- Holden -->
    <div class="border-t border-border pt-16">
      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-text-primary mb-6">Holden Bryce</h2>
      <p class="text-xs tracking-widest uppercase text-text-muted mb-6">Founder &amp; CTO</p>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Detroit roots. Full-stack engineer. Holden founded 1404 to close the gap between construction companies and the technical talent they've never had access to. He built 1404's first unified system — a full operations platform for a national construction company — in two months. They went from spreadsheets to real-time everything, and believed in what we're building enough to come on as equity partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pattern was the same everywhere. Companies that needed technology couldn't find it. People who built technology didn't understand the industry. The intersection was empty. That's why 1404 exists.

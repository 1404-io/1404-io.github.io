      of construction and manufacturing companies under 100 employees have no technology department. Not a bad one — none at all.
    </p>

    <p class="text-text-body text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
      The gap isn't software. There are many solid SaaS products. The gap is talent — someone continuously focused on evaluating, building, and maintaining technology for your operations. Even if recruiting was a priority, top-tier technical talent rarely works in these industries. They chase the shiniest job.

          <p class="text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
            Strategy, architecture, and a technology roadmap for your company. Weekly calls with your team, vendor evaluations with actual technical depth, and someone accountable for every technology decision — when to buy, when to build, and why.
          </p>

          <p class="text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
            One application built around how your company actually operates. Sales, project management, inventory, scheduling, financials — all in one place, all talking to each other natively. Not six different logins duct-taped together, and not a Frankenstein of tools welded on over the years. One system, fitted together from the start.

          <p class="text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
            Agents that run in the background around the clock, checking budgets, schedules, inventory, and utilization every 30 minutes. Your team talks to the system in plain language and gets real answers. The longer it runs, the more it learns about your business — your workflows, your patterns, the things that used to fall through the cracks.

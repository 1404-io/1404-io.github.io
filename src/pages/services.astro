        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-text-primary mb-6">CTO Leadership</h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Strategy, architecture, and a 3-to-5-year technology roadmap your company doesn't have yet. Weekly calls with your team, monthly reviews that actually move things forward, and someone who evaluates vendors with technical depth instead of trusting the last sales deck that came through the door.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most companies in these industries make technology decisions by committee, by gut, or by whoever bought lunch. That's how you end up with twelve disconnected tools and no strategy. A CTO changes that — one person accountable for every technology decision in your company, with the context to make them well.

      <!-- Custom Unified Systems -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-text-primary mb-6">Custom Unified Systems</h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Software designed around how your company actually operates, not the other way around. Every module talks to every other module natively — your project management talks to your labor forecasting, your purchase orders talk to your inventory, your scheduling talks to your financials. Not through integrations or middleware, but because it was all built as one system.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a project manager updates a schedule, the labor forecast recalculates in milliseconds. When a purchase order gets approved, inventory updates in real time. One system, complete information, no more logging into three apps and copy-pasting into a fourth.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- AI Operations -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-text-primary mb-6">AI Operations</h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Agents that run in the background around the clock, checking budgets, schedules, inventory, and utilization every 30 minutes. Your team talks to the system in plain language — "What's the status on the Michigan project?" "How much did we spend on materials last quarter?" "Flag anything trending over budget." — and gets real answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system has persistent memory. It remembers every conversation, every decision, every workflow it's observed. The longer it runs, the more it understands about how your company operates — your patterns, your edge cases, the things that used to slip through.

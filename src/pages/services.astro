        <div class="space-y-6 text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Strategy. Architecture. The 3-to-5-year technology roadmap your company doesn't have. Weekly calls with your team. Monthly reviews that actually mean something. The person who decides whether to buy or build, who evaluates vendors with technical depth instead of sales decks, who translates business problems into engineering solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most construction companies make technology decisions by committee, by gut, or by whoever the last vendor was that bought lunch. That's how you end up with twelve disconnected tools and no strategy. A CTO changes that. You get one person accountable for every technology decision in your company, with the context to make those decisions well.

      <!-- Custom Unified Systems -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-text-primary mb-6">Custom Unified Systems</h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Software built around your operations, not the other way around. Every module connected to every other module. Your project management talks to your labor forecasting. Your purchase orders talk to your inventory. Your scheduling talks to your financials. Not through integrations. Natively. Because it was all built as one system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The difference matters. When a project manager updates a schedule, the labor forecast recalculates in milliseconds, not overnight. When a purchase order is approved, inventory updates in real time, not after someone remembers to update the spreadsheet. When your operations live in one unified system, decisions get made with complete information instead of whatever data someone managed to pull together this morning.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- AI Operations -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-text-primary mb-6">AI Operations</h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-text-body text-base leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Agents that monitor your business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Automated checks every 30 minutes. Budget tracking. Schedule adherence. Inventory thresholds. Labor utilization. The things your best project manager checks once a day, our agents check 48 times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your team talks to the system in natural language. "What's the status on the Michigan project?" "How much did we spend on materials last quarter?" "Flag any projects that are trending over budget." The system has persistent memory. It remembers every conversation, every decision, every workflow it's observed. Month 1, it's learning. Month 12, it knows your business better than most of your employees.
